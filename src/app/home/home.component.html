                Dr G.Bakthavathsalam (MS, FICS, FCCP, FAMS), the Managing Trustee and Chairman of KG Hospital, has grown the hospital organically from a 10-bed hospital in 1974 to the state-of-the-art healthcare provider it is today.  For his service to society, Dr Bakthavathsalam (fondly known as Dr GB) has received numerous coveted awards including Padma Shri Award from the President of India and Dr B.C.Roy Award from the Prime Minister of India.</p>
